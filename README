A JSON parser using JavaCC

A JSON parser (JavaCC generated - see JSON,jj).

Parse a JSON input stream and call back to an implementation
of Handler at various parse events.

The parser is unaware of the object graph being created,
concerning itself only with the identification of
JSON objects, arrays, members, elements and their values.

It is biased towards a collections-based result, supporting
generic parameters for the JSON concepts of objects
and arrays, however these can be simply marker interfaces
if required - their implementation is entirely opaque
to the parser. The generic parameters at the class, rather
than the method level arises from JavaCC's limitation in
that regard.

The parser discriminates values that are numeric, one of
the JSON literals true/false/null or strings, so that
the Handler implementation can act appropriately. 

To use the parser, instantiate it using one of the
standard JavaCC-generated constructors and then
call parse(Handler), parseObject(Handler)
or parseArray(Handler).

A number of deviations from the JSON standard are supported.
These are

- Strings may be single-quoted instead of double-quoted.
An embedded single quote must be escaped but a double
quote need not be

- Object names need not be quoted at all, however in
this case they must be alpha-numeric, like identifiers
in Java or C.

- Comments in either Java single or multi-line style
are supported. These are ignored by the parser.
